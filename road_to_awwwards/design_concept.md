<h2>CSS Techniques</h2>

The `<pre>` tag: Used for the ASCII “title” and “divider.” The `<pre>` element preserves spacing and line breaks, perfect for ASCII art.

body style: Sets a monospaced font (for that lo-fi typewriter feel) and a light background color.
pre.ascii-title, pre.ascii-divider: Slightly larger font and spacing for the ASCII art. While “Reset”: The small `\* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }` reset helps keep things neat.

```
/* General Page Reset */
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Basic HTML Styles */
body {
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
  background-color: #fafafa;
  color: #333;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin: 2rem;
}
```

<h3>Helpful Approaches</h3>

**A. Type Selectors**

Type selectors target HTML tags directly.
Example: p { ... }, h1 { ... }, etc.
Useful for global typography or default styling for certain elements.

**B. Class Selectors**
You can create different classes (e.g., .milestone, .banner, .step-label) to group elements that share the same style.
Classes make it easier to apply specific styles to specific sections without affecting the rest of the page.

**C. ID Selectors**
IDs (e.g., #header, #intro) are typically used for unique elements that appear only once on a page.
However, classes are often more flexible, so you’ll likely rely on them more.
IDs are handy for creating anchor links (like “Go to top” buttons).

**D. Descendant and Child Selectors**
Descendant selector: .timeline .milestone { ... }
Targets .milestone elements that are inside .timeline.
Child selector: .timeline > .milestone { ... }
Targets only the direct children of .timeline.

**E. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**
Pseudo-classes like :hover, :focus, :active are great for interactive states on buttons or links.
Pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after let you insert decorative content (like ASCII lines or icons) without adding extra HTML.

**F. Attribute Selectors**
Not as common for simple pages, but you can target elements based on attributes (for example, a[href^="https"] to style external vs. internal links differently).

**G. nth-child Selectors**
If you want to style items in an ordered list or timeline differently by their order (e.g., alternate background colors), you can use :nth-child(even) and :nth-child(odd).

<h2>Tips for an Awwwards-Level Website</h2>

While this roadmap is intentionally simple, here are some design/development tips to help you level-up over time:

Focus on Typography: Awwwards judges love sites with strong typographic hierarchy and attention to detail.
Micro-Interactions: Subtle hover effects, animated transitions, or interactive elements can make your site feel polished.
Performance: Make sure your site loads quickly. Optimize images, minify CSS/JS, etc.
Accessibility: Use semantic HTML, descriptive alt tags, proper contrast for text, and ARIA labels where needed.
Consistency & Branding: Choose a color scheme or aesthetic and apply it consistently across your site(s).

<h3> Ideas for Stylistic Flourishes </h3>

ASCII or “Terminal” Touches
Use the monospace font family for a consistent typewriter or command-line feel.
Insert ASCII borders or shapes around your headings by using:

`<pre> `tags in HTML, or
::before/::after pseudo-elements in CSS (so you can keep your HTML clean).

**Timeline-Like Layout**

Consider giving each milestone its own “container” (class: .milestone?), with a border, background color, or horizontal rule to separate them.

Use margin or padding in a consistent way to space them out.
Possibly style the milestone “title” differently from the milestone “description.”

**Hover Effects for Links**

A simple way is to use a pseudo-class selector like a:hover to change the link color, underline style, or add a small animation.

**Minimal Color Palette**

Pick a limited set of colors:
One for backgrounds (like near-white or very light gray).
One or two accent colors for text, borders, or highlights.
Keep your typography mostly black/gray for readability; use accent colors sparingly for emphasis.

**Structural / Layout Tips**

Use semantic HTML: `<header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>.`

Wrap your timeline in a `<section> or <div> `with a class—for example, .timeline—then each milestone in a nested element like `<div class="milestone">`.
Responsive Considerations:
Use relative sizing (like em, rem, %) for margins and padding.
Let your layout adapt to smaller screens by using fluid widths or media queries.
